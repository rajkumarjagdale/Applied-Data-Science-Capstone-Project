# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone Project

Welcome to the Applied Data Science Capstone Project, the final course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. This project integrates all the skills and knowledge gained throughout the program into a practical application.

ðŸ“„ Project Background

SpaceX has transformed the commercial space industry by significantly reducing the cost of space travel. One key to their cost efficiency is the reuse of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. While a Falcon 9 launch costs $62 million, other providers charge over $165 million per launch. Predicting whether the first stage will successfully land is crucial for estimating launch costs. In this project, we'll use public data and machine learning models to forecast the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing.

ðŸ“„ Key Questions

How do variables like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits impact the success rate of first-stage landings?
Has the success rate of first-stage landings improved over time?
What is the most effective classification algorithm for this binary classification problem?

ðŸ“„ Methodology

Data Collection

Gather data using the SpaceX REST API
Perform web scraping from Wikipedia for additional information

Data Wrangling

Filter the data and address missing values
Use One Hot Encoding to prepare the data for binary classification

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA through visualization and SQL queries

Interactive Visual Analytics

Create interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly Dash

Predictive Analysis

Develop, tune, and evaluate classification models to identify the best algorithm for predicting successful first-stage landings
