# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone Project
This Capstone is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization and serves as a culmination of the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program. The project involves applying what we have learned to a real-world scenario.
ðŸ“„ Project Background
SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable. A key aspect of their cost savings is the reuse of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. The cost for a Falcon 9 launch is $62 million, compared to over $165 million with other providers. Predicting whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 will land successfully can help estimate launch costs. This project will use public data and machine learning models to forecast the likelihood of successful first-stage landings.
ðŸ“„ Questions to be Answered
1.	How do factors such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success rate of first-stage landings?
2.	Has the rate of successful landings improved over the years?
3.	What is the most effective algorithm for binary classification in this context?
ðŸ“„ Methodology
1.	Data Collection
o	Utilize the SpaceX REST API
o	Perform web scraping from Wikipedia
2.	Data Wrangling
o	Filter the data and handle missing values
o	Apply One Hot Encoding to prepare the data for binary classification
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Conduct EDA using visualization tools and SQL queries
4.	Interactive Visual Analytics
o	Use Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive data visualization
5.	Predictive Analysis
o	Build, tune, and evaluate classification models to determine the best algorithm for predicting first-stage landing
